The public REST APIs are often used to build the Jamstack web applications. Instead of looking up the correct API on the internet, we can visit [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) to find the API.

[RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) is home to over 35000+ APIs of 45 different categories. If you don’t have an account, you would first have to [sign up](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) on the website to use the APIs. Afterward, a unique API Key will be generated for you. With this API key, you will have access to all APIs.

You can publish any public REST API on RapidAPI Hub. All you need is an account. In this piece, let’s look at what steps you need to take to publish an API under your name on RapidAPI Hub. So without any further ado, let’s jump in!

## Publishing APIs on RapidAPI Hub

You can refer to the following steps to learn how to publish APIs on [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel):

### → STEP #1: Finding an API to Publish

Let’s look up a public API that we can publish on RapidAPI Hub. I have decided to go with [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for this piece, but if you want to publish some other API, the steps will stay the same.

### → STEP #2: Creating an account

Create an account on [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) if you haven’t already. For this, [click here](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) and sign up either by providing a username, work email, and password or using your Google, GitHub, or Facebook account.

### → STEP #3: Creating Your First API

Once you have successfully signed up and logged in, click `My APIs` on the navigation bar. It will take you to a page where you can add new APIs. Start by giving your API a name, a brief description, and choosing its category from the dropdown menu. Once you are done, click on the `Add API` button.

It will take a second, and then the API you have just created will be under the `My APIs` category from the sidebar.

### → STEP #4: Adding Additonal details

Click on the `Definition` under your API on the sidebar. You will see different fields here related to adding a long description, an image to represent your API, the API's website, and whether you want to add the terms and conditions. Fill in all the details and then click on Save.

Now click on `Add a base URL` at the top for adding the API base URL. It will change the UI where you will have the' Configure' button under the `Base URL` category. Go ahead and click on it. It will open a popup where you have an input box to add the base URL of your API.

Once you are done, click on `Add some endpoints` at the top and click on `Create REST Endpoint`.

![Adding REST Endpoint of your API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidAPI/DevRel-Stack-Data/12a1f39817287fca68fdd878403799406d09719c/guides/posts/add-apis-on-rapidapi-hub/images/rest-api-endpoints.png)

Fill in all the required information like the endpoint's name, a brief description, the HTTP method used with the endpoint, and the endpoint itself. Once you are done, press `Save`.

I have created more endpoints for fetching fake todos, comments, users, albums, and photos through the same steps.

Once you are done, click on the `Make your API public` at the top and toggle the switch under the `API Visibility` section to make the API public.

Now scroll to the top and click on the `View in Hub` to see how your API looks like on [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel).

## Wrap Up

That’s pretty much. You can also monetize your APIs if you want. All you need to do is set up some price plans inside your API definition, and you are good to go.
