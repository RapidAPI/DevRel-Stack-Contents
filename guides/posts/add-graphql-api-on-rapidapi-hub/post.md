## Publishing a GraphQL API on RapidAPI Hub

You can publish any public API on RapidAPI Hub, including GraphQL APIs. The process is straightforward, and all you need is your API and a free [RapidAPI account](https://RapidAPI.com/auth/sign-up?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel).

Before starting, make sure you have a functional and deployed GraphQL API. Follow these steps to publish your GraphQL API on RapidAPI Hub:

### → STEP #1: Create an account

Create an account on [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) if you haven’t already. For this, [click here](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) and sign up either by providing a username, work email, and password or using your Google, GitHub, or Facebook account.

### → STEP #2: Add the API

Once you have successfully signed up and logged in, click `My APIs` on the navigation bar. It will take you to a page where you can add new APIs. Here you will provide the basic information about your API. Give it a name and description, and choose a category.

Start by giving your API a name, a brief description, and choosing its category from the dropdown menu.

### → STEP #3: Specifying the Schema

We can specify our API using multiple options, as you can see above in the **Specify using** field. For your GraphQL API, select the GraphQL Schema option. Then, provide your GraphQL endpoint URL in the **Base URL** field. Finally, you can define your API by uploading your GraphQL schema file or an introspection call.

Once you are done, click on the `Add API` button. It will take a second, and then the API you have just created will be under the `My APIs` category from the sidebar.

### → STEP #4: Add Additonal Details

Once you add your API, it will navigate you to the API dashboard. You will see different fields related to adding a long description, an image representing your API, the API's website, and whether you want to add the terms and conditions.

### → STEP #5: Set a Pricing Plan

If you want to monetize your API, click on the **Plans and Pricing** tab in your API dashboard. Here you will be able to set usage quotas and define payment plans for your API.

### → STEP #6: Publish on RapidAPI Hub

Once you are done, click on the `Make your API public` at the top and toggle the switch under the `API Visibility` section to make the API public.
