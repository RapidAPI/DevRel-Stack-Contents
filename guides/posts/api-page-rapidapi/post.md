There are thousands of public REST APIs available on the internet that you can use to build web applications, desktop applications, command-line tools, etc. Despite their numbers, finding a suitable API for your app can become tedious if you search the web to find the right one. But with [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel), you can do all this in under a few minutes.

In this piece, we will look at all the different sections you encounter when you open an API page on [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel). So without any further ado, let’s jump in!

## RapidAPI Hub API Page

Make sure you have signed up and logged in to your RapidAPI account. Otherwise, you will not be able to subscribe to any API. Once it’s done, choose any API you like. For the sake of this piece, I am going with the [Famous Quotes API](https://RapidAPI.com/saicoder/api/famous-quotes4?utm_source=RapidAPI.com%2Fguides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel). Go ahead and subscribe to it.

As you can see, the page is divided into six sections:

-   `Top Info`: Here, the name of the API is present along with other details.
-   `Navigation`: Here, you can switch between different screens related to the API.
-   `Description`: This section contains the description of the API.
-   `Endpoints list`: This area lists down all the API endpoints available to the user.
-   `Request`: This section contains different options that you need to set to use the API.
-   `Response`: You can use this area to copy code snippets for calling the API, check the example response (if there is any), and look at the results the API call has brought with it.

Let’s take a deeper look at each of these six sections.

### Top Info

This part of the page holds the basic information related to the API like its name, author name, when it was last updated, what category it lies into, etc. You can also see the API's popularity, latency, and service level stats. These stats help you decide whether you should go with this API or look for another one on the [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel).

### Navigation

#### Endpoint

This is the default page that you see. It contains three sections. The leftmost section contains the list of endpoints, the middle section adds different options and makes the API request, and the rightmost section shows the API response, among other things.
